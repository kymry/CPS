##  Course Projects for combinatorial problem solving course at UPC Barcelona: 

Three different implementations of an optimization problem using Constraint Programming (CP), Linear Programming (LP), and Boolean Satisfiability Programming (SAT).

Constraint Program (CP):
Uses C++ and the Gecode library

Linear Program (LP):
Uses C++ and the CPLEX library from IBM

Boolean Satisfiability Program (SAT):
Uses C++ and the Lingeling library
