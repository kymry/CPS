##  Course Projects for combinatorial problem solving course at UPC Barcelona: 

Three different implementations of an optimization problem using Constraint Programming (CP), Linear Programming (LP), and Boolean Satisfiability Programming (SAT).

Constraint Program:
Uses C++ and the Gecode library

Linear Program:
Uses C++ and the CPLEX library from IBM

Boolean Satisfiability Program:
Uses C++ and the Lingeling library

See individual project README for usage instructions

Problem Instances of various sizes/complexities can be found in the Instances folder
